/*
 * All of the SDKs for the Ad Networks are very different architecturally. 
 * For RevMob and MobClix Generic Ad class provides a nice wrapper and almost everything can be manipulated through it.
 * For Chartboost Generic Ad class provides a very thin wrapper calls are basically just rerouted but again doing this highly decouples our design
 * & improves overall quality and structure.
